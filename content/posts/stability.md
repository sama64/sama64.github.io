stability is the enemy of getting things done

you might have goals, things you want to achieve in life, things you want to be good at

but when you're comfortable in a routine, and you feel safe and validated by your bubble, you don't tend to work towards your goals

stability leads to inaction

instability leads to action bc uncertainty makes you feel stressed and nervous.\
uncertainty makes you think, and makes you act

too much stability can make you fall asleep

you can get too comfortable studying for a piece of paper or working on something you don't care about

humans by default just want to be spoonfed\
we don't want to think hard\
we don't want to have agency

agency is a rare quality

humans normally don't think what their objectives are\
and neither do they plan to get them\
even less they act towards them

so it's just normal that when a hooman feels comfortable enough he just stops thinking

and you fall in the routine trance\
and you forget your objectives\
and you sleep on your plans

and you don't act\
you just live in your little bubble

in your routine of inaction towards what you really want\
because you're comfortable\
because you don't want to think hard

that's why most people are stuck in a routine they're not happy on it\
they're just comfortable, they sit on that feeling for years

they learn that 'nothing ever happens' in their lives\
and they see people that does what they once dreamed of as a different species

_"i could never do something like that, I'm too dumb"_

you're not dumb\
you just don't want to think\
bc you mistakenly learned that you don't have control over your life

resisting failure, trying again, failing again, and trying again is a skill\
is a muscle you need to train

you don't allow yourself to suck because you're too scared of failure

most of the people that built the modern world are not geniuses\
they just learned how to resist failure and iterate\
to keep trying, failing most of the time, and having little successes consistently

the longer you keep avoiding failure and not allowing yourself to suck\
the harder it will be to start

keep failing\
**keep failing**\
make things that make you uncomfortable

literally make a list of things that make you feel uncomfortable just thinking about them and pick one to do

allow yourself to suck in that thing you want to be good at and keep failing\
until the erosion of failure wears you down and shapes you to be good at it

otherwise you're gonna be stuck in the loop forever
