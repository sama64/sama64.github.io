I'm a person with a lot of curiosity, and I like to learn things for fun :D

I love automation, AI, and open-source ~i use arch btw. Right now, I'm in my third year of mechatronics engineering, but don't let that fool you - I can be extremely dumb.

Warning: Excessive goofiness and occasional cringe attacks may occur. Proceed with caution. 

I'm going to be writing here about the things I learn, my thoughts, and maybe some fiction!

Also, feel free to contact me to say hi if you want! My DMs are open :3
