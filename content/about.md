So, I'm a person with a lot of curiosity, and I like to learn things for fun :D

I love automation, open-source, and AI. Right now, I'm in my second year of mechatronics engineering, but don't let that fool you - I am extremely dumb.

I advise you that I'm totally cringy and goofy most of the time. I just want to write about the things I learn, my thoughts, and maybe some fiction!

Also, feel free to contact me to say hi if you want! My DMs are open :3
