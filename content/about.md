So i'm an engineering student with a lot of curiosity, and i like to learn things for fun :D

I advice you that I'm totally cringy and goofy most of the time. I just want to write about the things i learn, reviews, reflections, and maybe some fiction!

Also feel free to contact me to say hi if you want!
My dm's are open :3
